# Library-Management
I have created a simple library management system using Python IDLE and MySQL database
The idea was to keep the UI simple and plain. When first started you will see a small window containing three options for the librarian to choose from i.e Books, Members and Issue/Return.

<br>
When we open the Book panel we will go to a page where we can perform CRUD operations on the book table.

<br>
In here you will see the options to enter,update and delete a book. You can also search for the book by name and author and the word doesn't need to proper as it will show all the likely options. There is a button to get the list of books.

<br>
Next comes the option of adding, apdating and deleting books.

<br>
Next comes the Members Panel

<br>
Next comes the Issue/Return Panel
<br>

<br>
Unfortunately the coding of both issue and return is done but the UI is ineffective.
